##Orange Database Linear Model per Tree

This presentation is being created as part of the peer assessment for the coursera developing data products class. The assignment is geared toward ensuring the following concepts were well understood by the students

- **shiny** to build data product application
- **R-Presentation or slidify** to create data product related presentations

##The Application
To display the understanding of using **shiny** to build an application, a very simple application called **Orange Dataset Linear Model** has been developed and deployed at: 
https://tiagocberti.shinyapps.io/DevDataProd_project/

The application allows the user to:
- Select the input as the tree to subset the dataset;
- View the plot of the data and the linear model associated;
- View the formula of the linear regression.


##The Data
This application is based on Orange dataset from the package datasets.

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/tiagocberti/DevDataProd/tree/master/Week4/ShinyProj).

The application can be found at:
[shinyapp](https://tiagocberti.shinyapps.io/DevDataProd_project)

##Data

```{r datasets}
library(data.table)
